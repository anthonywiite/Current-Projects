# Current-Projects


Primarily used as a portfolio.

School Projects will be seperate from these and private.

Also going to be used as a form of referrence as I progress in skill.

All projects are a work in progress, I primarily use vscode and xcode.

Feel free to share some advice and pull some of my projects!
